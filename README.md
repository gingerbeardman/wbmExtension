Safari App Extension for Wayback Machine (web.archive.org)

# Why

The official Safari App Extension for the internet archive's Wayback Machine didn't fulfill our needs and we thus felt, we could create something, which would serve ourselves and the community best.

The original concept for this extension was created by gingerbeardman, who is also the driving force behind the business logic

# Will it be in the App Store

The ultimate goal is to provide this as a free extension in the App Store

# Translations?
